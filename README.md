# Car Rental System

Welcome to my Car Rental System. I have created this Car Rental Service in C# and this time I will be adding a database by using SQL Management studio to store the User's information after they registered for example Name, Email, Password and Role. This project is currently in progress. I created the Login Method where the user will be able to Login by adding their email and password. The user is able to register as, for that I had to add the register method.
